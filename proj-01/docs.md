# Project Documentation

This document gives a brief overview of the code layout in this repository as well as the underlying client-server architecture.

## Configuration

The `config.ini` file defines host, port, magic values, and constants, and messaging protocol, agreed upon by client and server. It consists of several sections:

#### `[SERVER]`
Defines the server’s **host** and **port**.
- **`host`**  
  Determines the IP address on which the server listens.  
- **`port`**  
  Determines the TCP port on which the server listens.
#### `[CLIENT]`
Defines the client’s **host** and **port**.
- **`host`**  
  Determines the IP address to which the client attempts to connect.  
- **`port`**  
  Determines the TCP port to which the client connects.
#### `[ACCOUNT]`
- **`db_name`**  
  The filename of the database used for account and message storage.  
- **`max_texts`**  
  The maximum number of text messages to store or process in certain operations.
#### `[MESSAGE]`
- **`msg_magic`**  
  A numeric signature used to validate messages.  
- **`msg_magic_size`** and **`msg_type_size`**  
  Sizes (in bytes) reserved for validating the message header.  
- **`msg_max_size`**  
  The maximum allowed payload size for a single message.
#### `[PROTOCOL]`
- **`protocol`**  
  Specifies how messages are serialized. For instance, `json` indicates JSON-based encoding, and `custom` indicates the default custom protocol.
#### `[ACTIONS]`
- **`actions`**  
  Points to `actions.json`, which defines the available actions and how they are routed or handled by both client and server.

## Actions

The `actions` folder contains the implementation for handling client and server actions in the system. It consists of two key files:

### 1. `actions.json`
This file defines the mapping between action codes and their corresponding action names. It provides a reference for handling actions programmatically. For instance, created mappings are of the form:

```
{
    "00000000": "status",
    "00000001": "create_account",
    "00000002": "delete_account",
    "00000003": "login_account",
    "00000004": "logout_account",
    "00000005": "send_text_message",
    "00000006": "fetch_text_messages",
    "00000007": "delete_text_message"
}
```

### 2. `actions.py`
This file implements action handlers for different system components. It defines three main classes inheriting from **BaseActionHandler**:

#### **BaseActionHandler**
- A generic class that loads action mappings from `actions.json`.
- Provides a method (`execute_action`) to dynamically execute mapped functions.
- Maintains both forward and inverse mappings of action codes for standardizing message type representation.

#### **ClientCallbackHandler**
- Handles client-specific callbacks upon receiving a server response.
- Implements functions to update the UI based on received actions (e.g., `create_account`, `send_text_message`).

#### **ClientActionHandler**
- Implements client-side logic to send action requests to the server.
- Constructs messages using the `utils.message` module and sends them via the client's network endpoint.
- Supports actions such as `create_account`, `delete_account`, `login_account`, and `fetch_text_messages`.

#### **ServerActionHandler**
- Implements server-side logic to process incoming client requests.
- Calls database functions (`account_db`) to perform requested actions.
- Handles user authentication, account management, and message processing.

## Database

The `server_sys` folder contains `db.py`, which implements the account database. It manages user accounts, conversations, and messages through SQLite.

### **Database Structure**
#### Tables:
1. **Users**: Stores user credentials.
2. **Conversations**: Tracks conversations between users.
3. **Messages**: Stores messages exchanged within conversations.

### **Key Functions**
#### **Account Management**
- `create_account(username, hashed_password)`: Registers a new user.
- `login_account(username, hashed_password)`: Authenticates user credentials.

#### **Conversations**
- `create_conversation(username_1, username_2)`: Initializes a chat between two users.

#### **Messaging**
- `send_text_message(username_1, username_2, message_text)`: Sends a message in an existing or new conversation.
- `fetch_text_messages(username, k)`: Retrieves the last `k` messages for a user.

## Testing
The `test_database.py` script uses `pytest` to validate the database functionality.

### **Test Cases**
- **User Account Tests**: Verify account creation, login, and duplicate user handling.
- **Conversation Tests**: Ensure conversations are created and handled properly.
- **Message Tests**: Test sending and retrieving messages.
- **Concurrency Tests**: Ensure correct concurrent access handling.

The `test_db.py` script provides a way to inspect the SQLite database contents for debugging. It prints out all tables and their data for verification.

## Server-Client Architecture

- **Server**:
  - Listens for incoming client connections on a configured host and port.
  - For each connected client, spawns threads to receive messages and queue them for processing.
  - Executes server-side actions based on message types and sends responses back to the client.
  
- **Client**:
  - Connects to the server on a configured host and port.
  - Sends messages (wrapped in a `Message` object) to the server.
  - Receives responses from the server and processes them with client-specific callbacks.

**Data Flow**:
1. **Client** sends a message to the **Server** with a specific message type and arguments.
2. **Server** receives the message, determines the appropriate server-side action, and executes it.
3. **Server** sends a response (which may be one or more messages) back to the **Client**.
4. **Client** processes the response, possibly updating a user interface or performing additional logic.


### Server Components

- **Server** defined in `server.py` orchestrates the entire server lifecycle: accepts connections, reads messages from clients, delegates actions, and returns results back to clients.

**Key Attributes**:
- `host`, `port`: Network details for binding and listening.
- `server_socket`: The main socket that listens for new client connections.
- `client_message_queues`: A dictionary mapping each connected `client_socket` to a `queue.Queue` object containing unprocessed messages.
- `executor`: A `ThreadPoolExecutor` used to run action-related tasks (to avoid blocking the main server loop).
- `action_handler`: An instance of `ServerActionHandler` (from `actions/actions.py`) used to handle server-side actions, like account creation or message forwarding.
- `account_db`: An instance of `db.AccountDatabase` for managing user accounts.

#### Key Methods

1. **`__init__()`**  
   - Initializes server configurations (host, port, DB paths, etc.).
   - Prepares the server socket.
   - Starts the main loop by calling `start()`.

2. **`start()`**  
   - Binds the server socket to the specified host/port and listens for new connections.
   - When a client connects:
     - Creates a dedicated message queue for that client.
     - Spawns:
       - **`recv_client_message(...)`**: continuously receives messages from that client socket.
       - **`process_queued_messages(...)`**: pulls messages from the per-client queue and passes them to the thread pool for processing.

3. **`recv_client_message(client_socket, addr)`**  
   - Reads a 4-byte length header to determine the incoming message size.
   - Reads the message payload based on that length.
   - Decodes the message into a `Message` object.
   - Validates the message; if valid, places it in the client’s message queue.

4. **`process_queued_messages(client_socket)`**  
   - Runs in a loop while the client is connected.
   - Fetches messages from the client’s queue.
   - Submits each message to the thread pool by calling `perform_action(...)`.

5. **`perform_action(message_type, message_args, client_socket)`**  
   - Invokes `action_handler.execute_action(...)` to handle the given `message_type`.
   - Sends the result(s) back to the client using `send_client_message(...)`.

6. **`send_client_message(client_socket, message)`**  
   - Encodes the `Message` and sends a length header followed by the message payload to the client socket.

### Client Components

**Client** defined in `client.py` defines the client’s connection to the server, including sending messages and handling server responses. It also provides a way to integrate UI callbacks (e.g., for updating a GUI output).

**Key Attributes**:
- `host`, `port`: Configured to match the server’s connection details.
- `client_socket`: Socket object for maintaining the client connection.
- `connected`: Flag indicating whether the client is currently connected.
- `server_message_queue`: A queue storing messages received from the server.
- `action_handler`: A `ClientActionHandler` that executes logic on the client side (often minimal).
- `callback_handler`: A `ClientCallbackHandler` that integrates with UI callbacks.
- `executor`: A `ThreadPoolExecutor` for processing messages from the server.

#### Key Methods

1. **`__init__(ui_callback)`**  
   - Sets up client configuration (host, port) from `config.Config()`.
   - Initializes the client socket and attempts to connect to the server.
   - Spawns threads for receiving server messages (`recv_server_message`) and processing them from a queue.

2. **`connect()`**  
   - Connects to the server socket using the provided `host` and `port`.
   - If successful, starts threads for `recv_server_message` and `process_queued_messages`.

3. **`recv_server_message()`**  
   - Continuously reads messages sent by the server.
   - Each message is decoded into a `Message` object and validated.
   - Pushes valid messages onto `server_message_queue`.

4. **`send_server_message(message)`**  
   - Sends a `Message` object to the server (length header plus JSON- or custom-encoded data).
   - Handles exceptions gracefully and disconnects if the server is unreachable.

5. **`process_queued_messages()`**  
   - Serially processes messages from `server_message_queue`.
   - For each message, calls `perform_callback(...)` on the `ClientCallbackHandler`.

6. **`disconnect()`**  
   - Closes the client socket and marks `connected` as `False`.

## Supporting Modules

### `utils/message.py`
- **`Message`** class encapsulates a message’s structure: a “magic” prefix for validation, a message type, and the serialized content.  
- Provides:
  - `encode()`: Converts the message into a parsable string.
  - `decode() / from_bytes()`: Reconstructs a message from raw byte data.
  - `valid()`: Validates that required fields (magic prefix, type) exist.

### `utils/config.py`
- **`Config`** class retrieves user-defined or default settings (e.g. host/port, database file paths, etc.).
- Example usage:
  ```python
  CFG = config.Config()
  server_host = CFG.get_server_config()['host']
  ```
### `utils/utils.py`
- `recv_all(socket, n)` is a helper function to poll until all specified `n` bytes are read from the `socket`.
