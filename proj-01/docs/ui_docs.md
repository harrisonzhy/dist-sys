### 3. Settings UI

The settings page allows users to adjust message-related preferences:

- Save settings and return to the main UI.

### 4. Send Message UI

Users can send messages by:

- Entering the recipient's username.
- Typing the message content.

#### `handle_create_account()`
- Hashes the password using SHA-256.
- Calls `action_handler.create_account()` to create a new user account.

### 2. Settings Management

#### `save_settings()`
- Updates the `max_texts` setting and displays a confirmation message.

### 3. Messaging System

- Calls `action_handler.send_text_message()` to send the message.
- Refreshes the UI after sending.

#### `update_inbox()`
- Clears previous messages and reloads them in a chat-like format.
- Displays messages with delete buttons aligned by sender status.

#### `delete_message(counterparty, message_id)`
- Removes a message from session storage.
- Calls `action_handler.delete_text_message()` to delete it from the backend.
- Refreshes the inbox UI.

#### `refresh_inbox()`
- Fetches new messages from the server using `action_handler.fetch_text_messages()`.
- Updates the UI after retrieving new messages.

### 4. Account Management

## Client-Server Interaction

The application interacts with the backend through `action_handler`, which performs the following operations:

- `login_account(username, password)`: Handles user authentication.
- `create_account(username, password)`: Registers a new user.
- `send_text_message(sender, recipient, text)`: Sends messages between users.
- `fetch_text_messages(username, max_texts)`: Retrieves messages for the user.
- `delete_text_message(message_id)`: Deletes a message from the system.
- `delete_account(username)`: Removes a user account.
